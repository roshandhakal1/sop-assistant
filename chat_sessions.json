They include procedural guidelines for manual payment processing, EFT payments, and reversing assigned checks in the Ross Payables Module.\n\n2. **Relevance**:\n   - While the SOP documents do not directly pertain to the operation or training of automatic capsule filling machines, they highlight the structured nature of SOPs within the organization. This suggests that similar structured documentation and training protocols are likely in place for other operational areas, including production and equipment training.\n\n### Actionable Information\n\n1. **Reading the Document**:\n   - Yes, the uploaded document can be read and understood. It provides clear objectives, instructional methods, and historical context that are essential for training personnel on automatic capsule filling machines.\n\n2. **Implementation**:\n   - For effective training, ensure that all required materials (computer and headset) are available for participants.\n   - Utilize the lesson plan to guide the training sessions, focusing on the objectives and completion criteria to assess learner understanding.\n\n3. **Integration with SOPs**:\n   - While the uploaded document does not directly reference the SOPs, it is advisable to maintain alignment with organizational training standards. Consider developing SOPs for the operation of automatic capsule filling machines that mirror the structured approach seen in the payment processing SOPs.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe uploaded document is a well-structured training resource that can be effectively utilized for educating staff on automatic capsule filling machines. While the relevant SOP documents do not directly relate to this training, they underscore the importance of structured documentation across the organization. For further implementation, ensure that training aligns with existing SOP standards to maintain consistency and quality in training delivery.",

To be able to efficiently produce high quality capsules to provide for our consumers, state-of-the-art automatic capsule filling machines were brought into ProCaps to not only meet the demand for capsules, but to ensure the highest quality capsules get to our consumers.\n\nBuilding upon ENC101: Intro to Capsules, this lesson has been developed to provide basic, introductory information about automatic capsule filling machines and how they work that can be adapted to eLearning and used to guide On-the-Job Training for theoretical knowledge and knowledge application.\nLesson Objectives \nIntroduce foundational knowledge about automatic capsule filling machines.\nDevelop a basic understanding of how the automatic capsule filling machines work by looking at the seven stations of the machine.\nLesson Completion Criteria\nKnowledge Assessment: \u2265 80%\nInstruction Methods\nSelf-paced eLearning \nRequired Materials\nComputer with web access\nHeadset\nExercises and Job Aids\nJob Aid: Capsule Filling Timeline\nJob Aid: Automatic Capsule Filling Machine Stations\nMatching Exercise\nLesson Plan Color Coding Key\nBlack text is regular, in-process lesson content.\nBlue text is an indicator or aid for the facilitator or instructor for a knowledge component and reference information.\nRed text indicates critical information.\n\n\nWhat is an Automatic Capsule Filling Machine?\nHistory of Capsule Manufacturing\nEarly 20th Century: Manual Filling\nCapsule filled by hand (usually done by pharmacists)\nSlow and tedious process\nInconsistent fills and dosages\nOnly suitable for small operations and quantities; still used in compounding pharmacies and for personal use\nImages of the historic methods:\nPharmacists would use a \u201cPunch Method\u201d \u2013 after mixing powders in a mortar and pestle, pharmacists would separate the capsules and then pour a pile of powder, take the capsule body and \u201cpunch\u201d it in the powder until the body was full; they would rejoin the cap and the body manually.\nLater, small instruments were made to hold the capsule bodies in place, pharmacists or technicians could scrape the powder over the holes and tamp the powder down with a pin, still had to manually separate and close the capsules.\n1930s \u2013 1950s: Semi-Automatic Machines\nMachines separated and closed empty capsules; still had to be manually filled\nCan still be found in some compounding pharmacies!\n1960s \u2013 1970s: Early Automatic Machines\nIntroduction of fully automatic capsule filling machines\nMechanically separate, fill, and close capsules\n\nWidely adopted by pharmaceutical companies due to being able to handle high volumes with consistent dosing\n1980s \u2013 Present: Modern Automation\nPrecise and programmable machines\nIncreased efficiency through integration of digital controls, sensors, and robotics\nCan fill capsules with powders, pellets, liquids, mini-tablets, mini-capsules\nSome automatic capsule filling machines can make up to 450,000 capsules per hour!\nCapsule Filling Methods/Machines Through the Years (Imagery)\n\n\n\nInteractive visual timeline with examples of the equipment\nModern Automatic Capsule Filling Machines \nModern Automatic Capsule Filling Machines are high-precision, heavy machinery that contains a lot of moving parts.\nWhile different models may vary in design and capacity, the basic capsule filling lifecycle remains consistent. \nThe machines that we use, internally referred to as \u201cBosch,\u201d are comprised of 7 stations.\nEach of these stations are made up of various parts that are timed, calibrated, and aligned to ensure consistent, efficient production.\nTo make a capsule, we have to introduce the empty capsules and the filler material, separate the caps from the bodies, fill them with material, rejoin and lock the capsules, and eject the finished capsules from the machine. \nSeven Stations for Automatic Capsule Filling\n\n\nRectification and Separation (different stations but work together for capsule introduction to the machine)\nImagine pouring a bunch of socks into a drawer and then organizing them so the openings of the socks all face you. That\u2019s what the rectification station does but for capsules at a very high speed.\nAt 1:05 \u2013 1:16 in GKF Capsylon - Bosch capsule filling maschine.mp4\n1st step for starting the capsule filling cycle \nGoal is to go from random orientation to rectified, body-down orientation and then separate the cap from the body.\nRectification and Separation are typically grouped together.\nRectification:\nCapsule hopper \u2013 assembly includes an adjustable gate to increase or decrease the flow of the empty capsules into the machine.\nMagazine \u2013 Block that has vertical chutes that empty capsules fall into from the hopper to get them into a vertical position.\nWhen capsules are loaded into the empty capsule hopper, they will fill the hopper in all different orientations. For a successful fill cycle, the capsule needs to fill the segments (where the capsules are carried through the cycle) with the body pointing down and the cap pointing up.\nVertical Sorting Fingers: Push the capsules from a horizontal position to vertical into the segments with the cap on top and the body on the bottom.\nFun Fact: Manufacturers recommend that the pointed edge of the vertical fingers align with the part of the capsule that is just slightly below the cap edge (image)\nHorizontal Sorting Fingers: Push the capsule forward in a horizontal position with the body position.\nSorting Block: Keeps the empty capsules aligned in a position that prepares them for being deposited into segments.\nSeparation\nSegments: Blocks that have holes, or bores, to house the cap and body. Consist of corresponding upper and lower segments. \nUpper segments house the caps\nLower segments house the bodies\nSeparation Pins: Pins that fit into the suction shoe below the lower segment that ensure the body does not go lower than intended \nSuction Shoe: A block with holes that sits below the lower segments at the separation station that allows vacuum suction to come through to separate the body of the capsule from the cap.\nFlip Card Component:\nIf the vacuum suction is not strong enough, operators may notice the caps are not separating from the bodies.\nIf the vacuum suction is too strong, operators may notice that the caps are popping out of the upper segments.\n\n\nFigure 1 How the vertical and horizontal fingers work together\nSummary: The separation station is essential for opening the capsule so the body can be filled. By using vacuum-assisted separation, it ensures smooth, controlled process that sets the stage for accurate and efficient capsule filling. Empty capsule quality \u2013 moisture content and shell flexibility \u2013 significantly affect separation success.\n\nFaulty Capsule Ejection \nAt 1:17 \u2013 1:37 in GKF Capsylon - Bosch capsule filling maschine.mp4\nIf capsules do not separate, they will be ejected from the cycle at the Faulty Capsule Ejection station.\nThis helps ensure that segments do not get jammed with capsule fragments and that the powder intended for a capsule does not transfer onto a whole capsule. \nThese scenarios could lead to issues through the cycle if not caught \u2013 capsule fragments can get stuck in the segment bores.\nDosing (also referred to as the filling station)\nAt 1:40 \u2013 2:00 in GKF Capsylon - Bosch capsule filling maschine.mp4\nThink of the dosing station as the \u201cheart\u201d of the capsule filling process. Its main job is to ensure that each capsule receives the exact dosage of product needed to meet quality, safety, and regulatory standards.\nThe dosing station is critical as this is where the powder is introduced to the machine. \nPowder Hopper \nA cone-shaped funnel where powder is first introduced to the machine.\nThe hopper is shaped like a funnel to help powder flow downwards.\nInside the funnel is a feed auger that twists like a screw to ensure the powder moves downward consistently into the powder bowl.\nPowder Bowl & Powder Sensor\nA bowl that fills with powder from the funnel \u2013 creates a powder bed to sit on top of the dosing disc.\nThe powder sensor ensures there the amount of powder in the powder bowl is consistently uniform. Can be adjusted based on the characteristics of the powder.\nDosing Disc (also known as a tamping disc)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/FADerVQ-tPg\nA disc with holes, or bores, that comes in various sizes (referring to the dosing disc thickness, measured in millimeters) to accommodate different powder doses and capsule sizes.\nEnsures capsules are filled with consistent fill weights as specified in the formula by creating a slug. \nThe slug is a unit dose of powder that is compressed together as it moves through the 5 tamping stations.\nThe sixth station, also called the transfer station, pushes the slug down into the capsule body. \nTamping Pin Guide Ring\nA plate that ensures the tamping pins are aligned with the dosing disc bores.\nTamping Pin Block and Tamping Pins\nTo compress the powder, there are five tamping blocks that house tamping pins that move up and down to compress the powder. \nThis creates a slug that ensures consistent dosing/fill weights.\nTypically, the first tamping station is set to apply the most pressure and the fifth station is set to apply the least pressure.\nMay differ based on powder characteristics \u2013 some powders do not create slugs. \nSome powders reverse the pressures with the first station applying the least amount of pressure (or none at all!) and the fifth station applying the most.\nThe sixth station, also called the transfer station, pushes the slug down into the capsule body. \nClosing\nAt 2:01 \u2013 2:12 in GKF Capsylon - Bosch capsule filling maschine.mp4\nAfter capsules are filled, the cap and body are rejoined and locked at the closing station.\nClosing Pins \nThe upper and lower segment realign after the dosing station. \nThe next station has pins that will come up underneath the lower segment to gently push the body of the capsule up in to the cap.\nCounter Closing Block\nThe upper segments that are holding the cap are located underneath a counter closing block. As the pins push the body upward into the cap, the counter bearing will provide light pressure to the cap to ensure when the cap and body are joined, they will lock.\nProblems can arise from the closing station if:\nThe upper and lower segments are not properly aligned \u2013 capsules can get splits/tucks due to collision of the cap and body edges\nThe filler material is very coarse and/or sticky causing powder to buildup in the segment bores and changing the shape of the body resulting in a body fold.\nFinished Capsule Ejection\nAt 2:13 \u2013 2:18 in GKF Capsylon - Bosch capsule filling maschine.mp4\nAfter the capsule has been filled, closed, and locked, the finished capsule will be ejected from the machine.\nThe ejection station has ejection pins located underneath the lower segment that will push the capsules upwards.\nA tuft of air will then trigger to push the capsules out of the machine in a sloped chute.\nThese capsules will run through a polisher and land in a drum or container.\nProper alignment and timing is critical to avoid capsule breakage or jamming which could lead to machine stoppage or product quality issues.\nCleaning\nAt 2:31 \u2013 2:51 in GKF Capsylon - Bosch capsule filling maschine.mp4\nAfter the finished capsules are ejected, the emptied segments rotate to the cleaning section where pins with compressed air blow out any powder or capsule debris to ready them for starting the cycle all over again.\nSummary\nWe reviewed the history of capsule filling machines and learned that capsule filling has gone from a fully manual process to an automatic process using specially designed machines.\nWe introduced the way a capsule is made in modern capsule filling machines.\nWe described the basic functions of the seven stations that make up automatic capsule filling machines.\nExercises\nMatching Stations\nMatch the description with the station. \nRectification: Readies the capsules in a vertical orientation with the cap on top and the body on the bottom.\nSeparation: Ensures the cap is housed in the upper segment and the body is housed in the lower segment.\nFaulty Capsule Ejection: Removes non-separated empty capsules from the segments\nDosing: Prepares the filler material to the target dose and fills the capsule.\nClosing: Rejoins the cap and body and locks them closed.\nFinished Capsule Ejection: Removes the filled and locked capsules from the machine.\nCleaning: Removes debris from segments to prepare them for another cycle.\n\nFinal Knowledge Assessment\nWhich option reflects the sequence of the automatic capsule filling machine?\nDosing, Faulty Capsule Ejection, Closing, Rectification & Separation, Finished Capsule Ejection, Cleaning\nRectification & Separation, Dosing, Faulty Capsule Ejection, Closing, Finished Capsule Ejection, Cleaning\nFaulty Capsule Ejection, Rectification & Separation, Dosing, Closing, Cleaning, Finished Capsule Ejection\nRectification & Separation, Faulty Capsule Ejection, Dosing, Closing, Finished Capsule Ejection, Cleaning\n\nTrue or False: The closing station uses a tuft of air to join the cap and body of a capsule.\nTrue\nFalse\n\nThe term \u201cslug\u201d when talking about the capsule filling operation, refers to:\nA slimy soft-bodies animal\nHow much power a baseball player uses when hitting a ball\nA compressed unit of powder \nA tamping pin\n\nThe tamping pins are a part of the:\nRectification station\nSeparation station\nCleaning station\nDosing station\n\nThe dosing station has [x] tamping blocks and a transfer station.\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\nThe vacuum suction used for separating caps from bodies should be [blank] if the caps cand bodies are not separating.\nDecreased\nIncreased\nShut off\nInterrupted\n\nTrue or False: The transfer station is part of the dosing station.\nTrue\nFalse\n\nThe auger in the powder funnel helps to:\nPush empty capsules down into the magazine.\nPush powder down into the powder bowl consistently.\nPush powder through the vacuum hoses.\nRegulate the temperature in the hopper by spreading out the powder.\n\nDefects that come from the closing station include:\nPowder buildup in the dosing station\nSplits and tucks\nEmpty capsules\nCrushed empty capsules\n\nWhy is the dosing station considered the \u201cheart\u201d of the capsule filling process?\nBecause it pulses like a heart does.\nBecause it ensures the capsules are clean and free from excess powder.\nBecause it introduces empty capsules into the machine.\nBecause it fills the capsules with the required amount of material needed to meet quality, safety, and regulatory requirements.\nReferences and Resources\nSection 6.1 Related Policies and Procedures\nN/A\nSection 6.2 Additional References and Resources\nCapsule Filling: Making Cap Tucks a Thing of the Past | Tablets & Capsules Magazine\nCapsule machine\nEncapsulation_ Problem and Remedies | PPT\nGKF Capsylon -
